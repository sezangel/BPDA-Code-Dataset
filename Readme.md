This is the code and dataset of BPDA.  

Due to space limitations, the dataset will also be uploaded to google cloud drive.

We have selected some of the manufactured dataset mentioned in the paper for presentation, at the following link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jORzrHZtnxsnt2jBW3rEeZRGrjRzrVCJ?usp=sharing, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1siuNccnOGUW4tBD6SSmdRUbpY_cafpEp?usp=sharing). 

The rest of the dataset will be fully open-sourced after the publication of the paper.

In the Dataset folder, Real-dataset contains *SaTC Dataset* and *BPDA Dataset* (which have some overlap and are therefore placed in a unified folder), Loop-Dataset is the *Loop Dataset* described in the paper, which contains the actual firmware, custom-compiled files, and Datacon2023 dataset.
